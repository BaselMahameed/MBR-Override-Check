This project made to check if the MBR has overridden, 
and for do that first of all when we start the pc\laptop we run the "mbr-to-file" to store the real mbr in txt file. 
after that we will run the "mbr-compare" before we shutdown the pc\laptop and it will give us a result if the mbr had overriden or not.

Made with love.
